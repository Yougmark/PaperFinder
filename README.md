# PaperFinder

Have you ever struggled downloading papers outside the campus? This Google
Chrome Extension enables an one-click option taking you to the FREE access page
provided by UNC-CH. Happy working from home, Tar Heels!

ieee.explore.ieee.org, dl.acm.org, link.springer.com, and www.sciencedirect.com
are currently supported. Feel free to add the website you need. Pull requests
are welcome!

## How to install

:(, I am not planning to distribute this on Google Chrome Store
for now. You NEED to __download the source code, and upload it to your Google
Chrome under developer mode!__

Once you cloned/downloaded this repository, follow the steps below (copied from
[Google's website](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)):

1. Visit ``chrome://extensions`` in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by
clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three
horizontal bars. and select __Extensions__ under the __More Tools__ menu to get to the
same place).

2. Ensure that the __Developer mode__ checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

3. Click __Load unpacked extensionâ€¦__ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

I tested this with __Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)__. Let me
know if you meet any errors.

## How to use

For now, it is really simple but meets all my needs. It has less than 50 lines
of code after all. To use this Chrome extension, when you are on a paper
website of either IEEE, ACM, Springer, or ScienceDirect, click this extension
button, which is the rightmost one as being freshly installed. Then it will bring
you to the website with Free access.

You will be asked to log in with Onyen (mostly) for the first time or when your
login is not valid any more. It is just like when directed from library.unc.edu.
That is NOT a Phishing website I created, checkout the URL or source code!
